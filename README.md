# TensorflowExamples
* Implements of famous deepleanrning models using tensorflow
* Some models' implements are from book "TensorFlow实战",黄文坚、唐源，电子工业出版社

## Environment required
   All models are tested based on Tensorflow 1.0.0, other verison may have some API change

## File Introduction
1. MnistSoftmax.py
   Using softmax to solve Mnist handwritten digits classification
   The MNIST database of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples,
   and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST.
   The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

2. MnistMLP.py
   Using MLP to solve Mnist handwritten digits classification
   Using dropout and one hidden layer

3. MnistLeNet.py
   Using LeNet5 to solve Mnist handwritten digits classification
   LeNet is a Convolutional Neural Network, using maxpooling and conv2d
